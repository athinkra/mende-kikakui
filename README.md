# Mende Kikakui Unicode support

For information on the project see http://athinkra.github.io/mende-kikakui/

## Font

The Athinkra Mende Kikakui font is based on a PUA based font *JG Mende* designed by Jay Glavy and *
Uni1E800Mende* by Michael Everson, an update to *JG Mende* for the Mende Kikakui Unicode chart. The Glavy and Everson fonts have been adapted and used with permission. The font will be released under the OFL 1.1 license. The Glavy font was based on the glyph repertoire documented in Dalby 1967.

Kikakui Sans will be adapted to include glyphs used in the Unicode charts, Tuchscherer 1996 and Dalby 1967 to create a comprehensive Mende Kikakui font.

## Keyboard layouts

Keyboard layouts for Windows, OSX, Linux, Android and iOS will be developed.
