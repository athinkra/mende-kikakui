The font will be released under the OFL 1.1 license. The Glavy font was based on the glyph repertoire documented in Darby 1966.\r\n\r\nThe new font will be adapted to include glyphs used in the Unicode charts and in Tuchscherer 1996 as well as Darby 1966 to create a comprehensive Mende Kikakui font.\r\n\r\n### Input\r\n\r\n\r\n",
